I could access a ready-made dataset provided by the World Population Review website(worldpopulationreview.com), but it needed some modifying as it lacked fields like ‘Continents’ which would be a key part of my analysis later. (Worldpopulationreview, 2023)
The initial dataset provided by the World Population Review website had fields like Country names, Area, Growth Rate, World Population Percentage, Density and Population numbers for the years 1980, 2000, 2010, 2022, 2023, 2030 (Projections), 2050 (Projections) etc.
I modified this dataset in Excel by adding new columns like ‘Continents’ as it would be a good feature to divide the Countries from which analysis could be done and Population numbers for the years 1990, and 2015 extracted from previous versions of the dataset provided by the World Population Review website. This would help get more interesting analytics and visualizations done as we would have more ‘years’ fields to work with. I also took out columns I felt were unnecessary for my analytics for this project. I took out the projecting years as that I something I want to build on my own. After I was done modifying the dataset, I uploaded it to a GitHub repository from where I could host the dataset online by making it public so it could be accessed by everyone.
